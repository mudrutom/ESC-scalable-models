Scalable predictive models
==========================

The aim of the project is predictive modelling, e.g. classification and regression tasks.

The goal is to apply the existing algorithms on datasets with varying size and to evaluate how scalable those algorithms are.
Furthermore, we want to run the algorithms on [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) cluster computing engine, which seems
to be an ideal tool for large-scale data processing. Our experiments shall answer the question from which dataset size the
Spark computing engine is advantageous over the traditional approaches.
